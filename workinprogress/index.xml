      <description>&lt;p&gt;The way firms adjust to local labor supply shocks has gained attention in the literature following a worldwide increase in the mobility of labor. In this paper I study the consequences of a unique quasi-experiment in which Italian firms are affected by an exogenous negative labor supply shock. I implement a difference-in-differences analysis where I exploit the complete removal of immigration restrictions between Italy and Switzerland from 1999 to 2015 together with the distance of Italian firms from the Swiss border. I rely on rich social security data on the universe of Italian private sector’s firms and workers, coupled with cross-border workers characteristics from the Swiss social security database. I analyze how firm across different sectors adjust to this shock along three dimensions: factors’ prices, productivity, and capital accumulation. I find that treated firms have on average a 1.5 times higher turnover compared to firms in the control group. Within one year they replace all the separations and keep their size constant. In line with monopsony models, firms initially try to retain workers increasing their wages. As this appears to become too costly, I will next investigate further mechanisms of adjustment such as, investment in technology, labor productivity, and capital accumulation. I will finally provide evidence on how these changes reshape labor force participations and I will shed light on their implications in terms of costs of turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Job loss severely impacts consumption and many other aspects of households’ lives. The two most popular instruments to insure against job loss are Unemployment Benefits (UB) and Severance Payments (SP). In this paper we analyze the effect of SP and the interaction with UB on unemployment duration and on subsequent long-term post-unemployment outcomes (currently work in progress). We aim at investigating and disentangling the role of SP and UB on labor market outcomes up to 10 years after job loss.
We rely on the Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD) and exploit a reform which abolished SP for jobs starting later than 2003. At 36 months of tenure, workers become eligible to 2 months of SP. We implement a difference-in-discontinuity analysis and compare nonemployment durations of individuals laid off shortly before and after the 36 months tenure threshold. Looking at this discontinuity before and after 2003 allows us to capture the effect of the cut in SP on nonemployment duration.
Our results show that a shortage of cash on hand equivalent to two months of salary, conditional on unemployment benefits, reduces days in non-employment before next job by 10%. The magnitude of this effect varies according to the experience of the job loser: younger workers display a larger liquidity effect. In the next step we will analyze the impact of benefits’ generosity, distinguishing the role or UB and SP, on total employment duration, total labor income, and wage growth up to ten years after the first job loss relating these outcomes to the quality of the subsequent job.&lt;/p&gt;
