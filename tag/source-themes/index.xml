      <title>How do Firms adjust to Negative Labor Supply Shocks? Evidence form Migration Outflows (Job Market Paper)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The way firms adjust to local labor supply shocks has gained attention in the literature following a worldwide increase in the mobility of labor. I study the consequences of a unique quasi-experiment where Italian firms are affected by an exogenous
negative labor supply shock of migration outflows from Italy to Switzerland. I implement a Diff-in-Diff
specification leveraging on exogenous variation from the implementation of a policy in which Switzerland
granted free labor market mobility to EU citizens, and on different treatment intensity of Italian firms,
based on their distance to the Swiss border. I use detailed social security data on the universe of Italian
firms and workers, together with firms’ balance sheet data. I find 3 percentage points of treated firm does
not survive. Surviving firms show a puzzling result: despite replacing the lost workers and becoming
more capital intensive, treated firms are less productive and have a lower wage growth. I explain this
puzzle through the lens of a simple model of imperfect substitutability of workers. I show that low-skill
intensive firms do not suffer from any productivity losses and are able to pay their workers higher wages.
High-skill intensive ones instead face a tighter market for high skilled labor and drive the negative results
on productivity and wage growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Skill Content of Occupations across Low and Middle Income Countries: Evidence from Harmonized Data</title>
      <link>/otherwork/0wb/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Using new and harmonized worker-level survey data on tasks at work in the developing
world, this paper constructs, for the first time, a measure of the skill content of occupations
for 10 low and middle-income countries. Following Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003),
Acemoglu and Autor (2011), and Autor and Handel (2013), we map tasks into non-routine
analytical, non-routine interpersonal, and routine &amp;amp; manual skill groups. We find significant
differences in the skill mix used by workers across different occupations, with selected whitecollar occupations being intensive in Analytical and Interpersonal skills, while others— mostly
blue collar, but not only— being more intensive in Routine and Manual skills. We also find
that the rankings of occupations along the skill dimensions are quite stable across countries,
and they correlate significantly higher between middle- and low-income countries than
between them and the United States. Hence, the common practice of assuming the same
skill structure for occupations in the United States and other countries can be misleading.
Finally, we find that the heterogeneity of skill content between occupations (within countries)
tends to decrease with the level of income, while the heterogeneity within occupations
decreases only weakly (or not at all) for higher income levels. Taken together, these results
suggest that as countries develop, they tend to adopt and use certain skills more widely,
especially across occupations. This may suggest some degree of specialization in skills
content of tasks as countries develop, especially moving towards less occupation-specific
Analytical or Interpersonal skills that are becoming increasingly relevant across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
