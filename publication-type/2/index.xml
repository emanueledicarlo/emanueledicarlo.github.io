      <title>How do Firms adjust to Negative Labor Supply Shocks? Evidence form Migration Outflows (Job Market Paper)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The quality of workers in a country positively relates to productivity of firms, adoption of new technologies, and growth. This paper studies adjustments of Italian firms to negative labor supply shocks in the context of workers&amp;rsquo; outflows from Italy to Switzerland. My Diff-in-Diff leverages the implementation of a policy in which Switzerland granted free labor market mobility to EU citizens and different treatment intensity of Italian firms based on their distance to the Swiss border. Using detailed social security data on the universe of Italian firms and workers, I document large outflows of workers and fewer surviving firms in the treatment group. Despite replacing workers and becoming more capital intensive, treated firms are less productive and pay lower wages.
I explain this evidence through the lens of a simple production function framework with high and low-skilled labor. In line with the brain drain literature I bridge the gap between losses of human capital and consequences on productivity by showing how these effects act through firms. I provide suggestive evidence that high-skill intensive firms are the main driver of the negative results on wages and productivity.  I also show that low skill intensive firms instead do not suffer from losing workers and provide new job opportunities for the workers who do not migrate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cash on Hand and Job Market Outcomes (joint with J. Zweimüller)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Job loss severely impacts consumption and many other aspects of households’ lives. The two most popular instruments to insure against job loss are Unemployment Benefits (UB) and Severance Payments (SP). In this paper we analyze the effect of SP and the interaction with UB on unemployment duration and on subsequent long-term post-unemployment outcomes (currently work in progress). We aim at investigating and disentangling the role of SP and UB on labor market outcomes up to 10 years after job loss.
We rely on the Austrian Social Security Database (ASSD) and exploit a reform which abolished SP for jobs starting later than 2003. At 36 months of tenure, workers become eligible to 2 months of SP. We implement a difference-in-discontinuity analysis and compare nonemployment durations of individuals laid off shortly before and after the 36 months tenure threshold. Looking at this discontinuity before and after 2003 allows us to capture the effect of the cut in SP on nonemployment duration.
Our results show that a shortage of cash on hand equivalent to two months of salary, conditional on unemployment benefits, reduces days in non-employment before next job by 10%. The magnitude of this effect varies according to the experience of the job loser: younger workers display a larger liquidity effect. In the next step we will analyze the impact of benefits’ generosity, distinguishing the role or UB and SP, on total employment duration, total labor income, and wage growth up to ten years after the first job loss relating these outcomes to the quality of the subsequent job.&lt;/p&gt;
